## Development

To use this repository, download or sync the `data` directory from 
[this URL](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/15e5BPkhECGeKTObdJIuixICMqhPhVyPK).

Move the zip file to a location that suits you, 
and create an environment variable called `$STORM_DATA_DIR` that points 
to the `data` directory.

To execute the notebooks, an installation of Python >=3.7 is required, and
Python 3.8 is recommended as that's what we've been using for development.

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
