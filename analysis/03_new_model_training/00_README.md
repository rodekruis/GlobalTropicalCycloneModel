## Report of analysis: code and steps

All the codes from number 01 to 15 are related to the analysis of the
input data, features, and the three main implemented models (regression, classification, and hybrid one).

Code 01 <br />
[Input data collection](01_collate_data.ipynb)

In this code we collect and combine the data needed to train the model including windspeed, rainfall and etc.

Code 02 <br />
[main regression model](02_model_training_baseline.ipynb)

In this code we applied the XGBoost regression model that obtained from analysis on baseline model on the collected input data (data in grid format).
