# READ ME for Rasterising Building Damage Data

The following section describes the files contained in the input folder.

- `adm3_area.csv`
  - contains the area of the polygons for the municipalities in the Philippines
  - exported from QGIS.
- `Adm3_Perc_inGrid_Weight_Matrix.csv`
  - shows the percentage of a grid covered by a specific municipality.
  - This is contained in the Grid Completeness column.
  - The values for one grid may not always add up to 100%
    - the grid may be partially overlaying a body of water.
- `Grid_Perc_inAdm3_Weight_Matrix.csv`
  - shows the percentage of a municipality that is in a grid.
  - This is contained in the Municipality Completeness column.
  - The values for one municipality tend to add up to 100%.
- `IMpact_data_philipines_SEP_2021.csv`
  - contains the typhoon impact data by municipality.
- `percentage_building_damage_bygrid.csv`
  - contains the output of the rasterisation of the building damage data.
- `phl_0.1_degree_grid.gpkg`
  - is the geopackage for the grid overlay as polygons on the Philippines
  - exported from QGIS.
- `phl_0.1_degree_grid_centroids.gpkg`
  - is the geopackage for the centroids of the grid overlay for the Philippines
  - exported from QGIS.
- `phl_adm3_grid_intersections_area.csv`
  - contains the area of the intersections of the municipalities and the grid
  - exported from QGIS.
- `phl_hotosm_bld_centroid_count.csv`
  - contains the number of building centroids per grid
  - a file combining output for the whole of the Philippines.
- `phl_north_hotosm_bld_centroid_count.csv`
  - contains the number of building centroids per grid
  - computed from the HOTOSM shapefile for north Philippines.
- `phl_south_hotosm_bld_centroid_count.csv`
  - contains the number of building centroids per grid
  - computed from the HOTOSM shapefile for south Philippines.

The following section contains the processes done in QGIS.

- Based on [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NprGn6_7gPuf3chmtxig53tGW5vxidM6tDiSOBbIgzM/edit),
  - a 0.1-degree grid appears suitable for the raster.
- The process of assigning a grid to municipalities is described in
  - [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZcjNHwtM40rFdigMmyG9PzseXmcU1KMpzO7m37s5hKI/edit)
- The Grid Completeness column shows how much of that grid was covered by the municipality.
- The process of assigning municipalities to grids was similarly done with the weighting.
- The process of getting the number of buildings per grid
  - from the HOTOSM data is described in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SUHeJTvT2dnshhINsf4q5wGycYuC4pRwleBrqj7K4QM/edit#).
