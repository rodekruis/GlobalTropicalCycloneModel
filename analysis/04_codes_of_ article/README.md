## Report of article codes 

All the codes from numbers 01 to 14 are implemented to get the result in different sections of the paper.


Codes <br />
[01_Bar plot of target variable in Municipality dataset](01_Municipality_dataset_plots.ipynb) <br />
[02_Bar plot of target variable in Grid dataset](02_Grid_dataset_plots.ipynb)

In this code we analyze the target variable in the municipality and grid-based datasets, to better understand the target variable's distribution. Therefore, we get the frequency of damage data, and as it is obvious we have a low number of samples for high values.

Achievements: This bar plot provides insights into class imbalances and target variable characteristics. In addition, this data visualization will support the decision-making throughout the modeling process.

Code <br />
[03_Correlation Matrix of features in Municipality dataset](03_Correlation_Matrix.ipynb)

This code is to find the relationship between all the features in the municipality-based dataset by the measure of the linear relationship between every two variables using [the Pearson correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient). We also search for highly correlated features which are specified in strong red (positive relationship) or strong blue (negative relationship).

Achievements: Since the Pearson correlation coefficient is used to identify relevant features in a dataset so it could be helpful in the variable selection process for the machine learning model.
