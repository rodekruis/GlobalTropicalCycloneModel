# Baseline Model

The baseline model analysis is based on
[this dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1XCfmkUuxzJayJWh11Qb09pHAfjpoUqZZ)
which has been compiled by 510 Global, from their work
developing a typhoon impact prediction model in the Philippines.

with script specific to creating this dataset available

## Report of analysis: code and steps

All the codes from number 01 to 09 are related to the analysis of the
input data, features, and even the two regression models.

### Codes number 01

In the code 01_Main_Correlation_Matrix,
feature selection was applied by using Correlation and Variance
Inflation Factor(VIF) among all the 38 features including the target. 
Value of 80 was considered as the threshold to express the highly
correlated pairs in correlation matrix and 7 was considered as the 
threshold for VIF result.

Achievement: Some features belong to the same category and those ones are the highly correlated pairs e.g. HAZ_v_max and HAZ_v_max_3 category of wind-speed.

### Codes number 02

Applied feature importance to input data using SHAP values and classifier construction
for models based on Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms, while for Linear Regression model,
the Regression Coefficients estimation was done.
1. After removing very highly correlated features(with 0.99 as thresholds) only for Random Forest and XGBoost
2. After removing features based on VIF for Random Forest, XGBoost and Linear Regression

Achievement:XGBoost model represents more stable with respect to Random Forest and mostly features related to wind speed or rainfall categorry are in the topest level. 

### Codes number 03

The input data includes 8073 samples while 4086 rows have zero values for
the target(damage percentage for the houses).
The point is most of these zeros were missing values in the originally
collected data so they were replaced with zeros with respect to the wind
field value and rainfall measurement.
A set of bin was defined to stratify dataset according to target
values(target value represent percentage of damage which is between 0 and
100 while 0 means no damage existance and 100 means the highest possible damage).

Some of the error metrics such as RMSE, MSE, MAE, and Average Error selected
to calculated model performance in a 20 runs while every run has a different
20/80 test training split of the same size, and with the stratified data.
The errors were estimated per each bins. In order to make a comparison of
error estimation values a new set of bin also defined.

It is good to highlight that in the whole error estimation in stratified process,
highly correlated features(>0.99) was removed from features in dataset.

### Codes number 04

After specifying two set of bins, a decision was made to make a
comparison of error estimation per bins for data with and without imbued zeros.

### Codes number 05

It is necessery to remark that, after studying the performance of linear
regression model on the input dataset, we will only keep on analyzing data
according to Random Forest and XGBoost models.
For both Random Forest and XGBoost models tried to use other hyperparameters
to reduce overfitting, and finally a best possible ReducedOverfitting model was
obtained for each made regression model which at least aided to increase train error
while keeping the test error same as before.
Subsequently the done analysis in this code was, RMSE and Weighted RMSE
estimation per bins for dataset with all target values and where damaged
values are greater than 10.

### Codes number 06

In addition of RMSE estimation per bins, the RMSE estimated
in total(not per bins) for dataset with all damaged values and
dataset where damaged values are greater than 10. 

### Codes number 07

In the all above scenarios (such as data with and without zeros, different
binsets, target greater than 10, ...), a scatter plot displayed True target
v alues versus Predicted values for two Regression Models.

### Codes number 08

RMSE estimation while not using train_test_split function but instead test
and train sets are fixed based on two different manually selected list of
typhoons as test data. Hence, 8 typhoons considered as the test set over
the total 39 typhoons. In each chosen list there are 4 sever and
4 mild typhoons in terms of their mean values.

### Codes number 09

The idea is to do a train-test-split based on the typhoon's time.
Therefore, typhoons are ordered with respect to their time of
occurrence and then the 8 recent typhoons are selected as the test set.
In the next, 8 different RMSEs are estimated while for each calculation
one of the less recent typhoons was dropped from the test set and added to
the train set. The idea is to determine how well the model performs in
learning from older typhoons' characteristics to make predictions on the
target value of the most recent ones.
