# Baseline Model

The baseline model analysis is based on
[this dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1XCfmkUuxzJayJWh11Qb09pHAfjpoUqZZ)
which has been compiled by 510 Global, from their work
developing a typhoon impact prediction model in the Philippines.

with script specific to creating this dataset available

## Report of analysis: code and steps

All the codes from number 01 to 09 are related to the analysis of the
input data, features, and even the two regression models.

### Codes number 01

Feature selection was applied by using Correlation and Variance Inflation Factor(VIF)
among all the 38 features including the target.  Value of 80 was considered as the threshold
to express the highly correlated pairs in correlation matrix and 7 was considered as the 
threshold for VIF result.

Achievement: Some features belong to the same category and those ones are the highly correlated pairs e.g. HAZ_v_max and HAZ_v_max_3 category of wind-speed.

### Codes number 02

Applied feature importance to input data using SHAP values and classifier construction
for models based on Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms, and Regression Coefficients estimation
for Linear Regression algorithm. Feature importance was done 1. After removing very highly correlated 
features(with 0.99 as thresholds) only for Random Forest and XGBoost and 2. After removing features 
based on VIF for Random Forest, XGBoost and Linear Regression

Achievement: output of XGBoost model is more stable than Random Forest and features related to weather data (wind speed,rainfall) are in the most important ones. 

### Codes number 03

Although the target values(percentage of damage houses) have a range from 0 to 100, there are only few cases with high damage.
Therefore, two different bin sets were defined to stratify target values of input data. 

Achievement: Stratification removed the risk of missing higher damage from training and test dataset, it slightly improves performance issues
caused by data imbalance


### Codes number 04

Model performance estimated per bin.

Achievement: The performance of the model seemed better in first bins.

### Codes number 05

A specific classifier was built for cases where the damage >10% and model performance was estimated per bin.
The weighted RMSE also used as another experiment to emphasize the higher damage.
The overfitting of models(Random Forest and XGBoost) reduced by changing values of hyper parameters or adding some new hyper parameters.

Achievement: The model on higher damage prediction performed better.

### Codes number 06

The performance of the model estimated in total(not per bin). 

### Codes number 07

Scatter plots for True values versus Predicted ones.

### Codes number 08

The performance of the model estimated while train-test-split was based on Typhoon’s Severity.
the total 39 typhoons. Test data includes 8 typhoons over 39 in total(half sever half mild typhoons).

### Codes number 09

The performance of the model estimated while train-test-split was based on Typhoon’s Time.
A real time usage was simulated to determine how well the model performs in learning from 
older typhoons' characteristics to make predictions on the target value of the most recent ones.
